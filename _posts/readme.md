From https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/:

To create a post, add a file to your _posts directory with the following format:

```YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP```

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md```
```2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md```

All blog post files must begin with front matter which is typically used to set a layout or other meta data. For a simple example this can just be empty:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
---

# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Insightful things here. 
```

to link to images, use the following syntax: 

```![backup-text](/assets/somefile.jpg)```

where somefile.jpg has been uploaded to the `assets` directory.
